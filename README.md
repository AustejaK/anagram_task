# Anagram task for oTree

In this task, participant has a list of anagrams that have to be solved under a time limit. 

It can be used as an effort task or a priming task. This version includes two treatments: easy (low difficulty anagrams) and difficult (higher difficulty anagrams).

You can access anagrams by clicking on numbered tabs. To make it easier to see your progress, you can "mark anagram as finished" (this will change the colour of the tab to green as seen in the image above).
